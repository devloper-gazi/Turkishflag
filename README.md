Hello,

A piece of code to print the Turkish Flag on the console screen with Node.js and javascript. 
If you wish, you can also print different content by changing the text content. 
The site required to convert the image to ASCII Code: "https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/convert-images-to-ascii-art/"

Yours sincerely.
